        The HOWL team consists of two sets of individuals.  The target users of the
        HOWL logger implementation provide the requirements that have driven the
        project.  This group includes the JOTM developers, the Apache Geronimo 
        developers, and the ActiveMQ developers.  The second group of individuals
        contributing to the HOWL project are the actual developers.

              Submitted a prototype for a trace package.  Although the trace package
              is not currently include in the HOWL distribution, it will serve as
              a good proof of concept if we attempt to add trace support in the 
              future.
