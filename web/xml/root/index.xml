		<s1 name="HOWL - High-speed ObjectWeb Logger" anchor="sect1">
			<p>
				HOWL is a logger implementation providing features
				required by the ObjectWeb JOTM project, with a public
				API that is generally usable by any Transaction Manager.
				HOWL uses unformatted binary logs to maximize
				performance and specifies a journalization API with
				methods necessary to support JOTM recovery operations.
			</p>
			<p>
				HOWL is intended to be used for logging of temporary
				data such as XA transaction events. HOWL is not a
				replacement for traditional log kits such as LOG4J and
				J2SE Logging.

				  TAG HOWL_0_1_11 committed to CVS.
				  <br />
				  Bugs fixed: 304047
				  <br />
				  The previous tagged version included a change
				  to the format of the XADONE records to assist
				  JOTM analysis of journal files.  As a result,
				  HOWL_0_1_10 could not open journal files that
				  had been created by previous versions.  This
				  creates a potential migration issue for JOnAS
				  and other applications using HOWL.  This version
				  recognizes both the new and old format of XADONE
				  records.
				</p>
