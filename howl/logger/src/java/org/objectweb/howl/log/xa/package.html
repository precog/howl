    Provides public logger classes customized for use with XA Transaction 
    Managers.
    <p>
      The XALogger class provides additional methods to put COMMIT 
      and put DONE records.  The XALogger class manages a table of
      active transactions and provides a handler for log overflow
      notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XALogRecord class provides additional members to access
      the XACommittingTx object associated with the record, and
      determine if the record is a COMMIT record.
