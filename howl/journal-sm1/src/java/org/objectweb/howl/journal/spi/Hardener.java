/**
 * A Hardener is responsible for doing all the real Jouraling
 * IO work.
 *
 * Hopefully we will have multiple Hardener implementations which
 * vary in terms of complexity and speed.  Different applicaions
 * will have different journaling performance and recovery requirements. 
 * Picking the right Hardener of the Journal should be what what
 * is need to accomodate those diffences.
 * 
 * A Hardener should be a regular Java Bean:
 *  * public default constructor
 *  * getter and setters methds for configuration
 *  * and it must implement this Hardener interface.
 * 
 * The hardener life cycle will be:
 *  1. construction
 *  2. set methods called to configure hardener options.
 *  3. open(...) method which should open/reopen the journal
 *  4. replayFromCheckpoint(...) 
 *  5. Then any of the following in any order and/or concurrently:
 *     * run()
 *     * getNextCheckPointID()
 *     * getLastClearedCheckPointID()
 *  6. close()
 * 
 * The run method should put the hardener into a processing
 * loop in which it will receive JournalEvent objects
 * from the eventQueue object passed to it in the open(...) method
 * call.
 *
